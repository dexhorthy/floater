# Floater Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Floater is a macOS desktop application that creates a small floating window (200x120px) that can contain text content and widgets. Built with Tauri + React.

## Implementation Priorities (High to Low)

### 1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Basic Window Configuration
- [x] Configure window to be 200x120px
- [x] Make window draggable
- [x] Make window non-resizable
- [x] Apply green on white theme

### 2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - CLI Interface Foundation
- [x] Create CLI binary (`floatercli`)
- [x] Implement `floatercli show "text"` command
- [x] Implement `floatercli hide` command
- [x] Setup IPC between CLI and Tauri app

### 3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Timer Widget
- [x] Create timer widget UI component
- [x] Implement stopwatch functionality (counts up)
- [x] Add `floatercli show "text" --timer` support
- [x] Handle widget state management

### 4. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Content Display System
- [x] Dynamic content rendering in floater window
- [x] Text content display
- [x] Widget container system
- [x] State persistence between show/hide

### 5. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Packaging & Distribution
- [x] Configure Tauri for macOS DMG
- [x] Bundle CLI binary with the app
- [x] Setup app to be launchable from Applications folder
- [x] Create installer workflow

## Technical Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Basic Tauri + React project scaffolded
- ✅ Window configured to spec (200x120px, draggable, non-resizable)
- ✅ Green on white theme applied
- ✅ CLI interface complete with timer support
- ✅ Timer widget functional
- ✅ Content display system working
- ✅ DMG packaging configured and working
- ✅ CLI binary bundled with app
- ✅ Installer script created

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Tauri (Rust)
- **CLI**: Go binary with Cobra CLI framework
- **IPC**: Unix domain socket communication
- **State Management**: React state for UI, Tauri commands for persistence

### Development Workflow
1. ✅ Start with window configuration (DONE)
2. ✅ Build CLI interface (DONE)
3. ✅ Add widget system (DONE)
4. ✅ Setup packaging (DONE)

## ✅ Project Complete

**All core features implemented and tested:**
- Floating window with draggable 200x120px interface
- CLI commands: `floatercli show "text"` and `floatercli hide`
- Timer widget support: `floatercli show "text" --timer`
- Production-ready DMG installer
- Bundled CLI binary for seamless installation

**Build & Install:**
```bash
make build     # Creates DMG and app bundle
./install.sh   # Installs CLI after dragging app to Applications
```
